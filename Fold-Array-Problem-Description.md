**Problem Description:**

You are given an array of integers and a positive integer `k`. The task is to fold the array `k` times. Folding an array means reducing its size by summing the symmetric pairs of elements. Specifically, in each fold operation, the array is divided into two halves, and the elements of the first half are added to the corresponding elements of the second half, starting from the outermost elements and moving inward.

For example, if you fold an array `[a, b, c, d]`, the result will be `[a+d, b+c]`.

The process is repeated `k` times until the array cannot be folded anymore. The goal is to determine the final state of the array after performing `k` folds.

**Input:**

- An array `A` of `n` integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`.
- An integer `k` (number of folds), where `0 ≤ k ≤ 1000`.

**Output:**

- The final state of the array after performing `k` folds.

**Constraints:**

- The array `A` contains integers where `-10^6 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^6`.
- The number of folds `k` is non-negative and the number of elements in the array reduces to at least one after `k` folds.

**Examples:**

1. **Example 1:**

   **Input:**
   ```
   A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   k = 1
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   [6, 6, 5]
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - After one fold: `[1+5, 2+4, 3]` = `[6, 6, 5]`

2. **Example 2:**

   **Input:**
   ```
   A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   k = 2
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   [10]
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - After the first fold: `[1+4, 2+3]` = `[5, 5]`
   - After the second fold: `[5+5]` = `[10]`

3. **Example 3:**

   **Input:**
   ```
   A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
   k = 3
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   [36]
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - Initial array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
   - After the first fold: `[1+8, 2+7, 3+6, 4+5]` = `[9, 9, 9, 9]`
   - After the second fold: `[9+9, 9+9]` = `[18, 18]`
   - After the third fold: `[18+18]` = `[36]`



# Count Words

**Problem Description:**

You are given a string of text. Your task is to count the number of distinct words in the text. For the purpose of this problem, a word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by spaces or punctuation marks. The word count should be case-insensitive, meaning that "Word" and "word" should be considered the same.

**Input:**

- A single line of text consisting of alphanumeric characters and punctuation marks. The length of the string will be between 1 and 10^6 characters.

**Output:**

- An integer representing the number of distinct words in the text.

**Constraints:**

- The text will contain only printable ASCII characters, including spaces and punctuation marks.
- The text length will be between 1 and 10^6 characters.

**Examples:**

1. **Input:**
   ```
   Hello world! Hello, everyone.
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   3
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   The distinct words are "hello", "world", and "everyone". Punctuation and case differences are ignored.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   9
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   The distinct words are "the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "lazy", and "dog". The word "the" is repeated and counted only once.

3. **Input:**
   ```
   A. B. C. a b c A B C
   ```
   **Output:**
   ```
   6
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   The distinct words are "a", "b", "c", "A", "B", and "C". All instances are considered the same word regardless of their case.

**Note:**

- Punctuation marks are used only to separate words. They are not considered part of the words.
- Ensure that your solution efficiently handles the upper limit of the text length.
