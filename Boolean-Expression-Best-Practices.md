# Chapter: Complex Boolean Conditions in C#

## Introduction to Complex Boolean Conditions

In C#, Boolean conditions are expressions that evaluate to either `true` or `false`. They are fundamental in controlling the flow of a program through decision-making constructs like `if`, `else`, and loops. As your applications grow more sophisticated, you will encounter scenarios where simple Boolean conditions aren’t enough to express the logic you need. This is where **Complex Boolean Conditions** come into play.

In this chapter, we’ll dive deep into combining multiple Boolean expressions using logical operators to create more intricate and powerful conditions.

## 1. Basic Boolean Conditions Recap

### What is a Boolean? 🧠

A Boolean is a data type that has two possible values: `true` or `false`. In C#, you typically use Booleans to make decisions in your code.

### Simple Boolean Expressions

A Boolean expression is any expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`. For example:

```csharp
bool isAdult = age >= 18;
bool isWeekend = dayOfWeek == "Saturday" || dayOfWeek == "Sunday";
```

In these examples, `age >= 18` and `dayOfWeek == "Saturday" || dayOfWeek == "Sunday"` are Boolean expressions.

---

## 2. Logical Operators

Logical operators allow you to combine multiple Boolean expressions into one complex condition.

### The `&&` (AND) Operator 🔗

The `&&` operator returns `true` only if **both** conditions are `true`.

```csharp
bool canVote = isAdult && isCitizen;
```

Here, `canVote` will only be `true` if both `isAdult` and `isCitizen` are `true`.

### The `||` (OR) Operator 🚪

The `||` operator returns `true` if **at least one** of the conditions is `true`.

```csharp
bool isWeekend = dayOfWeek == "Saturday" || dayOfWeek == "Sunday";
```

`isWeekend` will be `true` if `dayOfWeek` is either `"Saturday"` **or** `"Sunday"`.

### The `!` (NOT) Operator 🚫

The `!` operator inverts the value of a Boolean expression. If the expression is `true`, `!` makes it `false`, and vice versa.

```csharp
bool isNotWeekend = !isWeekend;
```

If `isWeekend` is `true`, then `

`isNotWeekend` will be `false`, and if `isWeekend` is `false`, then `isNotWeekend` will be `true`. The `!` operator is often used to check for the opposite of a condition.

## 3. Combining Conditions

When working with complex logic, you will often need to combine multiple Boolean conditions using logical operators. Understanding how these combinations work is crucial for writing correct and efficient code.

### Using `&&` and `||` Together 🧩

You can combine both `&&` and `||` in a single expression to check for multiple conditions. However, the order in which these operators are evaluated matters.

**Example:**

```csharp
bool isEligibleForDiscount = (age < 18 || age > 65) && isMember;
```

Here, the condition checks if a person is eligible for a discount. The discount applies if the person is either younger than 18 **or** older than 65 **and** is a member. 

### Precedence and Grouping with Parentheses 🎯

In complex Boolean expressions, the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator. This means that conditions connected with `&&` will be evaluated first. To control the order of evaluation, you can use parentheses `()`.

**Example:**

```csharp
bool result = true || false && false;
```

This expression will evaluate as `true` because `false && false` evaluates first (due to higher precedence), resulting in `false`, then `true || false` evaluates to `true`.

However, if you use parentheses:

```csharp
bool result = (true || false) && false;
```

Here, `true || false` evaluates first (because of the parentheses), resulting in `true`, and then `true && false` evaluates to `false`.

Parentheses help make your code more readable and ensure that conditions are evaluated in the intended order.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Checking Multiple Conditions 🕵️‍♂️

Consider a scenario where a user can only access a certain feature if they are logged in, have a premium account, and have not been banned. You can express this logic using a complex Boolean condition:

```csharp
bool canAccessFeature = isLoggedIn && hasPremiumAccount && !isBanned;
```

This condition ensures that the user meets all the necessary criteria.

### Validating User Input 💻

Imagine you’re developing a form where the user must enter a valid email address and a password with at least 8 characters. The logic could be:

```csharp
bool isValidInput = email.Contains("@") && password.Length >= 8;
```

This condition checks if the email contains an `@` symbol and if the password is long enough.

### Handling Complex Scenarios 🌐

In a more complex scenario, suppose you’re developing an online store. You want to offer a discount if the user is a new customer, has a promo code, or if it’s a holiday, **and** the user has items in their cart:

```csharp
bool applyDiscount = (isNewCustomer || hasPromoCode || isHoliday) && hasItemsInCart;
```

This expression ensures the discount applies only if the user meets at least one of the first three conditions **and** has items in their cart.

## 5. Common Pitfalls

### Misunderstanding Operator Precedence 🧩

One common mistake is forgetting how operator precedence affects evaluation. For example:

```csharp
bool result = true || false && false; // Evaluates to true
```

This expression evaluates as `true` because `&&` has higher precedence than `||`. It’s crucial to use parentheses to
make the intended order of operations explicit and avoid confusion.

### Neglecting Edge Cases ⚠️

When crafting complex Boolean conditions, it’s essential to consider edge cases. For example, if you’re checking for valid age ranges, don’t forget to include cases like negative ages or extremely high values.

**Example:**

```csharp
bool isValidAge = age >= 0 && age <= 120;
```

This ensures that the age is within a realistic range.

### Overcomplicating Conditions 🌀

Sometimes, developers write overly complex conditions that can be simplified. Complexity can make the code harder to read and maintain. 

**Overcomplicated Example:**

```csharp
bool isEligible = (isMember == true) || (isMember == false && age > 18) && (status != "inactive");
```

**Simplified Example:**

```csharp
bool isEligible = isMember || (age > 18 && status != "inactive");
```

The simplified version is easier to understand and maintains the same logic.

## 6. Best Practices

### Keep Conditions Readable 📚

Write Boolean expressions that are easy to read and understand. Use descriptive variable names and break down complex conditions into simpler, smaller pieces.

**Example:**

```csharp
bool hasValidSubscription = isSubscribed && !isExpired;
```

Here, the variables `isSubscribed` and `isExpired` clearly convey the intent.

### Simplify Where Possible 🧹

Whenever possible, simplify your conditions. Avoid unnecessary complexity by refactoring and combining Boolean expressions logically.

**Example:**

```csharp
// Before
bool shouldProceed = (userIsActive && !userIsSuspended) || (userHasAdminRights && !isOnVacation);

// After
bool shouldProceed = (userIsActive && !userIsSuspended) || (userHasAdminRights && !isOnVacation);
```

In this case, both conditions are logically grouped, making the code easier to understand.

### Use Methods for Repeated Logic 🛠️

If a condition is used in multiple places, consider extracting it into a method. This makes your code more modular and easier to maintain.

**Example:**

```csharp
bool IsEligibleForDiscount(Customer customer)
{
    return (customer.IsNewCustomer || customer.HasPromoCode || customer.IsHoliday) && customer.HasItemsInCart;
}

// Usage
if (IsEligibleForDiscount(currentCustomer))
{
    // Apply discount
}
```

Here, `IsEligibleForDiscount` method encapsulates the complex logic, improving readability and reusability.

## 7. Exercises

### Challenge Yourself

1. **Eligibility Check**: Create a method to check if a user is eligible for a special offer. The user is eligible if they are over 21 years old, have a membership, and have purchased more than $100 worth of items.

    ```csharp
    bool IsEligibleForOffer(int age, bool hasMembership, double totalPurchase)
    {
        return age > 21 && hasMembership && totalPurchase > 100;
    }
    ```

2. **Login Validation**: Write a Boolean expression to validate login credentials. The login is valid if the username is not empty, the password is at least 8 characters long, and the account is active.

    ```csharp
    bool IsValidLogin(string username, string password, bool isActive)
    {
        return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(username) && password.Length >= 8 && isActive;
    }
    ```

3. **Form Validation**: Develop a method to check if a form is valid. The form is valid if all required fields are filled out, and the email address contains an "@" symbol.

    ```csharp
    bool IsFormValid(string email, bool isNameFilled, bool isAddressFilled)
    {
        return email.Contains("@") && isNameFilled && isAddressFilled;
    }
    ```

### Additional Practice

1. **Quiz Questions**: Answer the following questions to test your understanding of Boolean conditions and logical operators:
    - What does the expression `!(true && false)` evaluate to?
    - How does the precedence of `&&` and `||` affect the evaluation of the expression `(false || true) && true`?
    - Refactor the following complex condition to make it more readable: `((x > 10 && y < 5) || z == 0) && !(w == 2 && v > 7)`.

2. **Code Review**: Review a piece of code containing complex Boolean conditions and refactor it to improve readability and maintainability.
