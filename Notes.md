### 2. Identify Your Target Audience
- **Create detailed audience personas**: Consider age, gender, profession, interests, educational background, and challenges they face.
- **Understand their needs and preferences**: Conduct surveys, engage in social listening, and analyze data from your existing audience to tailor content to their needs.

### 3. Establish Your Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
- **Define what sets you apart**: Highlight your unique experiences, insights, and teaching methods.
- **Communicate your UVP clearly**: Make sure your audience understands the benefits of engaging with your content.

### 4. Choose Your Content Pillars

- **Ensure diversity and relevance**: Mix evergreen content with timely topics to keep your audience engaged.

### 5. Develop a Content Plan and Calendar

Notes:

Coding is like giving instructions to a computer so it can do things, just like when you follow steps to build a LEGO set. You tell the computer what to do, step by step, and it listens and does exactly what you say. It's like making a list of steps for the computer to follow to play a game, draw a picture, or tell a story.

Nostalgia is when you feel happy and a little bit sad at the same time because you're thinking about something nice that happened a long time ago. It's like when you look at a picture from your last birthday party and remember all the fun you had, but you also wish you could have that fun again right now.
