Finding a cheap premium domain for IT courses involves searching for domain names that are both affordable and convey a sense of professionalism and relevance to IT education. Here are some strategies to find such domains:

### 1. Use Domain Marketplaces
Websites like Sedo, Flippa, and GoDaddy Auctions offer a wide variety of premium domains. You can filter by price to find affordable options.

### 2. Check Domain Registrars
Many domain registrars (like Namecheap, GoDaddy, and Google Domains) offer premium domains at competitive prices. Sometimes they have sales or special promotions.

### 3. Consider Newer TLDs
Instead of traditional TLDs (.com, .net), consider newer ones like .tech, .academy, .courses, .education, or .training. These are often cheaper and more relevant to IT courses.

### 4. Use Domain Name Generators
Tools like LeanDomainSearch, NameMesh, and BustAName can help generate creative domain names that are available and affordable.

### 5. Negotiate with Domain Owners
If you find a premium domain that fits your needs but is a bit expensive, consider reaching out to the owner to negotiate a lower price.

### Sample Domain Ideas

Here are a few examples of domain names that could be suitable for IT courses, some using newer TLDs:

1. **LearnIT.tech**
2. **CodeAcademy.courses**
3. **ITTraining.online**
4. **TechSkills.education**
5. **ITCourseHub.com**
6. **CyberClassroom.net**
7. **DevMasters.tech**
8. **LearnCoding.academy**

These names are illustrative; availability and price need to be checked.

### Additional Tips
- **Keywords:** Use keywords like "IT," "Tech," "Course," "Learn," and "Training" in your domain name to make it relevant.
- **Brandability:** Choose a name that's easy to remember and spell.
- **Length:** Keep it short and simple for better recall and typing ease.

By following these strategies, you should be able to find a cheap yet premium domain that suits your IT courses business.

# Number of Websites Worldwide
As of 2024, there are approximately 1.2 billion websites on the internet. However, this number is constantly changing as new websites are created and old ones are taken down or become inactive. It's important to note that not all of these websites are active or frequently updated; many are parked domains or inactive sites. The exact number can vary based on the source and the method of counting, but this estimate provides a general sense of the current scale of the web.
