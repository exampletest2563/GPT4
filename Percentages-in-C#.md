## Lecture: Percentages and Calculations with Percentages

Welcome to the lecture on Percentages and Calculations with Percentages in our C# course! üéâ In this session, we'll cover the basics of percentages, how to calculate them, and how to use them in C# programming with practical examples.

### 1. Understanding Percentages

A percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100. The symbol for percent is `%`. For example, 25% means 25 out of 100, or 0.25 in decimal form.

### 2. Converting Between Percentages and Decimals

To convert a percentage to a decimal:
- Divide the percentage by 100.
- Example: 50% = 50 / 100 = 0.5

To convert a decimal to a percentage:
- Multiply the decimal by 100.
- Example: 0.75 = 0.75 * 100 = 75%

### 3. Basic Percentage Calculations

#### Finding the Percentage of a Number

To find the percentage of a number, multiply the number by the percentage (expressed as a decimal).

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Percentage of a Number} = \text{Number} \times \left( \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \right) \]

**Example:**
```csharp
double number = 200;
double percent = 15;
double result = number * (percent / 100);
Console.WriteLine($"15% of 200 is {result}"); // Output: 15% of 200 is 30
```

#### Finding the Total from a Percentage

If you know a percentage of a total and want to find the total, divide the known value by the percentage (expressed as a decimal).

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Total} = \frac{\text{Known Value}}{\left( \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \right)} \]

**Example:**
```csharp
double knownValue = 50;
double percent = 25;
double total = knownValue / (percent / 100);
Console.WriteLine($"If 50 is 25%, the total is {total}"); // Output: If 50 is 25%, the total is 200
```

#### Increasing/Decreasing a Number by a Percentage

To increase a number by a percentage, add the percentage of the number to the original number.

**Formula to Increase:**
\[ \text{Increased Value} = \text{Number} \times \left( 1 + \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \right) \]

**Example:**
```csharp
double originalPrice = 100;
double increasePercent = 20;
double newPrice = originalPrice * (1 + (increasePercent / 100));
Console.WriteLine($"Increasing 100 by 20% gives {newPrice}"); // Output: Increasing 100 by 20% gives 120
```

To decrease a number by a percentage, subtract the percentage of the number from the original number.

**Formula to Decrease:**
\[ \text{Decreased Value} = \text{Number} \times \left( 1 - \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \right) \]

**Example:**
```csharp
double originalPrice = 100;
double decreasePercent = 20;
double newPrice = originalPrice * (1 - (decreasePercent / 100));
Console.WriteLine($"Decreasing 100 by 20% gives {newPrice}"); // Output: Decreasing 100 by 20% gives 80
```

### 4. Practical Examples in C#

Let's see some more practical examples of percentage calculations in C#.

#### Example 1: Calculating Discounted Price

```csharp
double originalPrice = 150;
double discountPercent = 10;
double discountAmount = originalPrice * (discountPercent / 100);
double discountedPrice = originalPrice - discountAmount;
Console.WriteLine($"Original Price: {originalPrice}, Discount: {discountAmount}, Discounted Price: {discountedPrice}");
// Output: Original Price: 150, Discount: 15, Discounted Price: 135
```

#### Example 2: Calculating Interest Earned

```csharp
double principalAmount = 1000;
double interestRate = 5; // Annual interest rate in percent
double interestEarned = principalAmount * (interestRate / 100);
Console.WriteLine($"Interest earned on {principalAmount} at {interestRate}% is {interestEarned}");
// Output: Interest earned on 1000 at 5% is 50
```

#### Example 3: Finding the Percentage Increase

```csharp
double oldValue = 80;
double newValue = 100;
double percentageIncrease = ((newValue - oldValue) / oldValue) * 100;
Console.WriteLine($"The percentage increase from {oldValue} to {newValue} is {percentageIncrease}%");
// Output: The percentage increase from 80 to 100 is 25%
```

### 5. Conclusion

Percentages are a fundamental part of many calculations in both everyday life and programming. Understanding how to work with percentages and convert between decimals and percentages is essential for developing robust C# applications. Use these examples as a foundation for more complex calculations in your projects. Happy coding! üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª

### Finding the Biggest Number Out of Two Numbers in C#

Below are several solutions to find the largest number out of two numbers using different approaches. Each example is formatted for educational use, including explanations and code listings.

#### 1. Using Math.Max

The simplest and most recommended way to find the maximum of two numbers in C# is by using the `Math.Max` method.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int max = Math.Max(a, b);
        Console.WriteLine("The maximum value is: " + max);
    }
}
```

üöÄ **Explanation**: This approach leverages the built-in `Math.Max` method, which is efficient, readable, and reliable. It's a single line of code that clearly indicates the intent.

#### 2. Using Conditional Statements

Another way to find the maximum value is by using conditional statements (`if-else`).

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int max;
        
        if (a > b)
        {
            max = a;
        }
        else
        {
            max = b;
        }

        Console.WriteLine("The maximum value is: " + max);
    }
}
```

üîç **Explanation**: This approach uses an `if-else` statement to compare the two numbers. While it's clear and straightforward, it is more verbose than using `Math.Max`.

#### 3. Using the Ternary Operator

The ternary operator provides a more concise alternative to the conditional statement.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
        Console.WriteLine("The maximum value is: " + max);
    }
}
```

‚ú® **Explanation**: The ternary operator `(condition) ? trueExpression : falseExpression` allows for a compact comparison. It's less verbose than an `if-else` but can be less readable for those unfamiliar with the operator.

#### Comparison of Approaches

1. **Using Math.Max**: 
   - **Pros**: Simplest, most readable, and most efficient. 
   - **Cons**: None significant.
   
2. **Using Conditional Statements**:
   - **Pros**: Explicit and easy to understand for beginners.
   - **Cons**: More verbose, potential for human error.

3. **Using Ternary Operator**:
   - **Pros**: Concise and compact.
   - **Cons**: Can be less readable for those unfamiliar with the ternary operator.

### Conclusion

While all three methods are valid, using `Math.Max` is generally preferred for its simplicity and readability. It leverages the power of the .NET framework, ensuring optimized performance and clear intent.

By understanding these different approaches, you can choose the most appropriate method for your specific use case, balancing readability, performance, and simplicity.
