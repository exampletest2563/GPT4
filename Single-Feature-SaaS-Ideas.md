3. **Template Library**: Develop a template library where users can browse and preview different invoice designs before making a selection.

4. **Dynamic Template Loading**: Use dynamic data and conditional formatting in Bubble.io to load different templates based on user selection. This involves using different groups or repeating groups that display the chosen template’s design.

5. **Template Import**: Enable users to import their own templates, possibly by uploading a custom design or using an HTML/CSS editor integrated into the application.

By offering these options, you can provide users with flexibility and variety in their invoice designs.


Implementing different invoice templates in Bubble.io involves a few steps:

1. **Create Template Designs**: Design multiple invoice templates using Bubble.io's visual editor. Use groups and repeating groups to structure the templates. Each template can be a different group or page.

2. **Template Selection**:
   - **Template Gallery**: Create a page or popup that displays thumbnail previews of each template. Use a repeating group to display all template options.
   - **Template Selection**: Add a workflow that sets a user's chosen template when they select a template from the gallery. This can be stored in the user's data type.

3. **Dynamic Template Loading**:
   - Use conditions to show or hide different template groups based on the user's selection. For example, if the user's chosen template is "Template 1," then only the group for Template 1 is visible.
   - Add conditional formatting to elements to adjust styles dynamically based on user preferences.

4. **Template Customization**:
   - Add input fields and color pickers to allow users to customize aspects of their chosen template, such as colors, fonts, and logos.
   - Bind these inputs to the invoice elements using dynamic data. For instance, a text element's font or color can change based on the user's input.

5. **Save Customizations**:
   - Create fields in your database to store customization options, like font style, color, and logo URL.
   - Update these fields whenever the user makes changes, ensuring the customizations persist and can be applied dynamically.

6. **Template Import**:
   - Provide an option for users to upload HTML/CSS files if you want to allow for custom templates. This requires additional handling to render and apply these custom templates properly.

1. **Design Template Structures**:
   - Use Bubble's design editor to create various invoice layouts.
   - Group elements for each template into separate groups.

2. **Create Template Selection Interface**:

   - Use image elements or thumbnails to give users a preview of each template.

3. **Implement Selection Workflow**:
   - Use Bubble's workflows to save the selected template to the user's profile.
   - For example, "When a template is clicked, set the user's chosen template field to the selected template ID."

4. **Display Chosen Template**:
   - On the invoice creation page, use conditional logic to display the chosen template.
   - Set conditions for groups like "When current user's chosen template is 'Template 1,' this group is visible."

5. **Customization Features**:
   - Add input fields, color pickers, and file uploaders for customization.
   - Bind these inputs to the template elements using dynamic expressions.

6. **Save and Apply Customizations**:
