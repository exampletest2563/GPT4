To imitate the use of affiliate links or codes without online payments, you can simulate the process in a controlled environment or through non-monetary means. Here are a few strategies you can use:

1. **Track Clicks and Conversions:**
   - Use URL parameters to simulate affiliate links. Create unique URLs for each "affiliate" and track clicks and conversions on your website or application.
   - Example: `www.example.com/product?affiliate=12345`

2. **Use Promo Codes:**
   - Generate unique promo codes that affiliates can share. When a user enters a promo code, track its usage to simulate a sale.
   - Example: `PROMO12345`

3. **Manual Logging:**
   - Create a manual logging system where you or your team record each referral manually. This could be a simple spreadsheet where you note down each referral's details.

4. **Points or Credits System:**
   - Implement a points or credits system where affiliates earn points instead of monetary rewards. These points can later be redeemed for non-monetary rewards or recognition.
   - Example: Affiliates earn 10 points for each referral, and 100 points can be redeemed for a gift.

5. **Use Dummy Payment Process:**
   - Implement a dummy payment gateway that mimics the process of online payments without actually processing any real transactions. This can be useful for testing and training purposes.

6. **Educational Simulations:**
   - Create an educational simulation or role-playing exercise where participants act as affiliates and customers. Track their interactions and "sales" through a mock system.

7. **Gamification:**
   - Incorporate gamification elements such as leaderboards, badges, or virtual achievements to motivate and track affiliate performance without real financial transactions.

By using these methods, you can effectively simulate the affiliate marketing process and gather useful data without the need for actual online payments.
