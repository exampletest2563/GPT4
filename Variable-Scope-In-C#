# Chapter: Understanding Variable Scope in C#

Welcome to this comprehensive chapter on variable scope in C#. In this chapter, we will explore what variable scope is, why it matters, and how to effectively use it in your C# programs. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a solid understanding of how variable scope works and how to apply it to write clean, efficient, and bug-free code. Let's dive in! 🚀

---

## 1. What is Variable Scope? 🧐

Variable scope refers to the context within a program where a variable can be accessed or modified. It defines the visibility and lifetime of a variable, determining where you can use a variable and when it goes out of scope.

In C#, the scope of a variable is typically defined by **code blocks**, which are enclosed in curly braces `{}`. When a variable is declared inside a code block, it is only accessible within that block and any nested blocks.

Understanding variable scope is crucial because it helps you manage memory efficiently, avoid variable naming conflicts, and prevent bugs related to unintended variable modifications.

## 2. Types of Variable Scope in C# 🔍

In C#, there are several types of variable scope:

1. **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside of any function, class, or namespace, available anywhere in the code. (Note: In C#, true global variables don't exist, but we can simulate global-like behavior using static classes.)

2. **Class-Level (Field) Scope**: Variables declared within a class but outside any method, available to all methods in the class.

3. **Method-Level (Local) Scope**: Variables declared within a method, only available within that method.

4. **Block-Level Scope**: Variables declared within any block of code (e.g., loops, conditionals) are only available within that block.

Let's explore each of these in detail with practical examples! 👨‍💻👩‍💻

### 2.1. Global Scope 🌍

In C#, there isn't a true concept of global variables like in some other languages. However, you can achieve similar behavior by using **static fields** or **properties** within a static class. This makes the variable accessible anywhere in your application.

#### Example:

```csharp
// GlobalScopeExample.cs
using System;

static class GlobalVariables
{
    public static int GlobalCounter = 0; // Static field, accessible anywhere
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Accessing the global variable
        Console.WriteLine($"Initial GlobalCounter: {GlobalVariables.GlobalCounter}");
        
        GlobalVariables.GlobalCounter++;
        Console.WriteLine($"Updated GlobalCounter: {GlobalVariables.GlobalCounter}");
        
        AnotherMethod();
    }

    static void AnotherMethod()
    {
        // Accessing the global variable from another method
        GlobalVariables.GlobalCounter += 10;
        Console.WriteLine($"GlobalCounter in AnotherMethod: {GlobalVariables.GlobalCounter}");
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
Initial GlobalCounter: 0
Updated GlobalCounter: 1
GlobalCounter in AnotherMethod: 11
```

In this example, `GlobalCounter` is accessible from any method in the program. It retains its value across different method calls, demonstrating a global-like behavior.

### 2.2. Class-Level (Field) Scope 🏛️

Class-level or field scope refers to variables that are declared within a class but outside any method. These variables are accessible to all methods in the class, and their lifetime is tied to the instance of the class.

#### Example:

```csharp
// ClassLevelScopeExample.cs
using System;

class Person
{
    // Class-level variable (field)
    public string Name;

    // Another class-level variable
    private int age;

    public void SetAge(int personAge)
    {
        age = personAge; // Accessing class-level variable
    }

    public void DisplayInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}, Age: {age}"); // Accessing class-level variables
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Person person1 = new Person();
        person1.Name = "Alice";
        person1.SetAge(30);
        person1.DisplayInfo(); // Output: Name: Alice, Age: 30

        Person person2 = new Person();
        person2.Name = "Bob";
        person2.SetAge(25);
        person2.DisplayInfo(); // Output: Name: Bob, Age: 25
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
Name: Alice, Age: 30
Name: Bob, Age: 25
```

In this example, `Name` and `age` are class-level variables. They can be accessed and modified by all methods within the `Person` class. However, `age` is private, meaning it cannot be accessed directly outside the class.

### 2.3. Method-Level (Local) Scope 📦

Method-level or local scope refers to variables that are declared within a method. These variables are only accessible within the method they are declared in and are destroyed once the method execution completes.

#### Example:

```csharp
// MethodLevelScopeExample.cs
using System;

class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        int result = a + b; // Local variable
        return result;
    }

    public int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        int product = a * b; // Local variable
        return product;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        int sum = calc.Add(5, 10);
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum: {sum}"); // Output: Sum: 15

        int product = calc.Multiply(5, 10);
        Console.WriteLine($"Product: {product}"); // Output: Product: 50
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
Sum: 15
Product: 50
```

In this example, `result` and `product` are local variables within their respective methods (`Add` and `Multiply`). They cannot be accessed outside these methods.

### 2.4. Block-Level Scope 🧱

Block-level scope refers to variables that are declared within a block of code, such as loops or conditionals. These variables are only accessible within that block.

#### Example:

```csharp
// BlockLevelScopeExample.cs
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int number = 10; // Method-level variable

        if (number > 5)
        {
            int square = number * number; // Block-level variable
            Console.WriteLine($"Square: {square}"); // Output: Square: 100
        }

        // Console.WriteLine(square); // Error: 'square' does not exist in the current context

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Loop iteration: {i}");
        }

        // Console.WriteLine(i); // Error: 'i' does not exist in the current context
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
Square: 100
Loop iteration: 0
Loop iteration: 1
Loop iteration: 2
```

In this example, `square` is a block-level variable inside the `if` statement, and `i` is a block-level variable inside the `for` loop. Neither can be accessed outside their respective blocks.

## 3. Common Scoping Mistakes and How to Avoid Them 🚨

Understanding variable scope is essential to avoid common mistakes that can lead to bugs. Here are a few common scoping mistakes and tips on how to avoid them:

### 3.1. Shadowing Variables 👥

Variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a scope has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior.

#### Example:

```csharp
// VariableShadowingExample.cs
using System;

class Program
{
    static int x = 10; // Class-level variable

    static void Main()
    {
        int x = 20; // Local variable, shadows class-level variable
        Console.WriteLine($"Local x: {x}"); // Output: Local x: 20

        Console.WriteLine($"Class-level x: {Program.x}"); // Output: Class-level x: 10
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
Local x: 20
Class-level x: 10
```

Here, the local variable `x` shadows the class-level variable `x`. To avoid shadowing, use unique variable names or explicitly reference the outer scope variable when needed.

### 3.2. Accessing Variables Out of Scope 🚫

Trying to access a variable outside its scope results in a compilation error.

#### Example:

```csharp
// OutOfScopeExample.cs
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        if (true)
        {
            int temp = 100;
        }

        // Console.WriteLine(temp); // Error: 'temp' does not exist in the current context
    }
}
```

To avoid this error, ensure that you declare variables in the correct scope where they are needed.

### 3.3. Overusing Global-Like Variables ⚠️

Using global-like variables (static fields) can make your code harder to maintain and debug, as changes to these variables can have far-reaching, unintended effects.

#### Example:

```csharp
// OverusingGlobalExample.cs
using System;

static class Globals
{
    public static int count = 0; // Global-like variable
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        IncrementCount();
        Console.WriteLine($"Count: {Globals.count}"); // Output
Continuing from where we left off...

#### Example (continued):

```csharp
// OverusingGlobalExample.cs
using System;

static class Globals
{
    public static int count = 0; // Global-like variable
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        IncrementCount();
        Console.WriteLine($"Count: {Globals.count}"); // Output: Count: 1

        DecrementCount();
        Console.WriteLine($"Count: {Globals.count}"); // Output: Count: 0
    }

    static void IncrementCount()
    {
        Globals.count++; // Modifying the global-like variable
    }

    static void DecrementCount()
    {
        Globals.count--; // Modifying the global-like variable
    }
}
```

#### Output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 0
```

While using a global-like variable such as `Globals.count` might seem convenient, it can make the code more difficult to maintain, especially in larger programs. This is because the state of `count` is shared and can be modified by any part of the program, potentially leading to unexpected side effects. 

To avoid overusing global-like variables:

- **Limit their use**: Use them only when absolutely necessary.
- **Consider encapsulation**: Use properties with private setters or encapsulate state in classes or methods to restrict access.
- **Use parameters**: Instead of relying on global variables, pass variables as parameters to methods.

## 4. Best Practices for Managing Variable Scope in C# 🏆

Understanding and managing variable scope effectively is key to writing robust and maintainable C# code. Here are some best practices:

### 4.1. Use Local Variables Whenever Possible 🗝️

Local variables have the narrowest scope, meaning they are limited to the method or block in which they are declared. This minimizes the chances of unintentional side effects and makes your code easier to understand and debug.

#### Example:

```csharp
// BestPracticeLocalVariables.cs
using System;

class Calculator
{
    public int CalculateSum(int a, int b)
    {
        int sum = a + b; // Local variable, use within this method only
        return sum;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int result = calculator.CalculateSum(3, 7);
        Console.WriteLine($"Sum: {result}"); // Output: Sum: 10
    }
}
```

### 4.2. Use Descriptive Names for Variables 📛

Use meaningful names that clearly indicate the purpose of the variable. This reduces the chance of errors and makes your code more readable.

#### Example:

```csharp
// BestPracticeDescriptiveNames.cs
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int numberOfApples = 5; // Descriptive variable name
        int numberOfOranges = 10;

        int totalFruits = numberOfApples + numberOfOranges;
        Console.WriteLine($"Total Fruits: {totalFruits}"); // Output: Total Fruits: 15
    }
}
```

### 4.3. Avoid Reusing Variable Names within Nested Scopes 🛑

Avoid using the same variable name in nested scopes, as this can lead to confusion and bugs.

#### Example:

```csharp
// AvoidReusingVariableNames.cs
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int value = 10;

        if (value > 5)
        {
            int value = 20; // Error: 'value' is already defined in the outer scope
            Console.WriteLine($"Inner Value: {value}");
        }
    }
}
```

This will produce a compile-time error. Instead, use unique variable names within each scope.

### 4.4. Encapsulate State with Properties and Methods 📦

Encapsulating state using properties and methods allows you to control how variables are accessed and modified, helping to maintain a clear and clean code structure.

#### Example:

```csharp
// EncapsulateStateExample.cs
using System;

class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance; // Private field, not directly accessible

    public decimal Balance // Public property
    {
        get { return balance; }
        private set // Restricting access to this setter
        {
            if (value >= 0)
            {
                balance = value;
            }
        }
    }

    public void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0)
        {
            Balance += amount;
        }
    }

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= Balance)
        {
            Balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
        account.Deposit(100);
        Console.WriteLine($"Balance after deposit: {account.Balance}"); // Output: Balance after deposit: 100

        account.Withdraw(30);
        Console.WriteLine($"Balance after withdrawal: {account.Balance}"); // Output: Balance after withdrawal: 70
    }
}
```

In this example, the `balance` field is encapsulated within the `BankAccount` class, and its access is controlled through the `Balance` property and methods `Deposit` and `Withdraw`.

### 4.5. Be Mindful of Static Variables and Thread Safety 🔒

When using static variables in multi-threaded applications, be aware of thread safety issues. Static variables are shared across all instances and threads, which can lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior.

To manage thread safety:

- **Use synchronization mechanisms** such as locks (`lock` keyword in C#) to ensure that only one thread can access a variable at a time.
- **Consider using thread-safe collections** or types provided by the .NET Framework, such as `ConcurrentDictionary`.

#### Example:

```csharp
// StaticVariableThreadSafetyExample.cs
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    private static int counter = 0;
    private static object lockObject = new object();

    static void IncrementCounter()
    {
        lock (lockObject)
        {
            counter++;
            Console.WriteLine($"Counter: {counter}");
        }
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(IncrementCounter);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(IncrementCounter);

        t1.Start();
        t2.Start();

        t1.Join();
        t2.Join();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `lock` statement ensures that only one thread can increment the `counter` variable at a time, preventing race conditions.

# Chapter: Building Complex Boolean Expressions in C#

Welcome to this deep dive into building complex Boolean expressions in C#! Understanding Boolean expressions is fundamental to programming, as they allow your code to make decisions and control the flow of execution. In this chapter, we’ll explore what Boolean expressions are, how to construct complex expressions using logical operators, and best practices to keep your code readable and efficient. We’ll provide practical, beginner-friendly examples every step of the way. Let’s get started! 🚀

---

## 1. What Are Boolean Expressions? 🤔

A **Boolean expression** is a logical statement that can evaluate to either `true` or `false`. In C#, Boolean expressions are built using **Boolean values** (`true` or `false`), **comparison operators** (like `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.), and **logical operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`).

Boolean expressions are the backbone of decision-making in programs, enabling conditional execution of code blocks based on certain criteria. Understanding how to create and manipulate these expressions is essential for writing effective and efficient programs.

### 1.1. Basic Boolean Values 🟢

The simplest Boolean expressions are the Boolean literals `true` and `false`. These values represent the two possible states of a Boolean expression.

```csharp
// Simple Boolean Values
bool isSunny = true;
bool isRaining = false;

Console.WriteLine(isSunny);  // Output: True
Console.WriteLine(isRaining); // Output: False
```

### 1.2. Comparison Operators 🔍

Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean result. Here’s a quick overview of the most common comparison operators in C#:

- `==`: Equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<=`: Less than or equal to

#### Example:

```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = 20;

Console.WriteLine(a == b); // Output: False
Console.WriteLine(a != b); // Output: True
Console.WriteLine(a > b);  // Output: False
Console.WriteLine(a < b);  // Output: True
Console.WriteLine(a >= 10); // Output: True
Console.WriteLine(b <= 15); // Output: False
```

### 1.3. Logical Operators ⚙️

Logical operators combine multiple Boolean expressions to form more complex conditions. The primary logical operators in C# are:

- `&&`: Logical AND
- `||`: Logical OR
- `!`: Logical NOT

#### Example:

```csharp
bool isAdult = true;
bool hasLicense = false;

Console.WriteLine(isAdult && hasLicense); // Output: False
Console.WriteLine(isAdult || hasLicense); // Output: True
Console.WriteLine(!isAdult);              // Output: False
```

## 2. Building Complex Boolean Expressions 🏗️

Now that we have a basic understanding of Boolean expressions, comparison operators, and logical operators, let's dive into building complex Boolean expressions. Complex Boolean expressions involve combining multiple Boolean expressions using logical operators to create more sophisticated conditions.

### 2.1. Combining Boolean Expressions with AND (`&&`) 🧩

The **AND** operator (`&&`) returns `true` only if **both** operands are `true`. It is commonly used to ensure multiple conditions are satisfied.

#### Example: Checking Multiple Conditions

Imagine you’re writing a program to determine if a person is eligible for a senior citizen discount. The person must be at least 65 years old and must have a valid membership card.

```csharp
int age = 70;
bool hasMembershipCard = true;

// Both conditions must be true
bool eligibleForDiscount = (age >= 65) && hasMembershipCard;

Console.WriteLine($"Eligible for Discount: {eligibleForDiscount}"); // Output: True
```

#### Example: Nested AND Conditions

You can nest AND conditions to check for more specific scenarios. For example, checking if a person is eligible for both a senior citizen discount and an exclusive event entry.

```csharp
int age = 70;
bool hasMembershipCard = true;
bool isEventMember = true;

// Nested AND conditions
bool eligibleForEvent = (age >= 65) && hasMembershipCard && isEventMember;

Console.WriteLine($"Eligible for Event: {eligibleForEvent}"); // Output: True
```

### 2.2. Combining Boolean Expressions with OR (`||`) 🔗

The **OR** operator (`||`) returns `true` if **at least one** operand is `true`. It is useful for checking if **any** condition is satisfied.

#### Example: Checking Either Condition

Consider a program to determine if a person is eligible for a youth or senior citizen discount. The person must be under 18 or at least 65 years old.

```csharp
int age = 70;

// Either condition can be true
bool eligibleForDiscount = (age < 18) || (age >= 65);

Console.WriteLine($"Eligible for Discount: {eligibleForDiscount}"); // Output: True
```

#### Example: Multiple OR Conditions

You can combine multiple conditions with OR to check for more scenarios. For example, checking if a person is eligible for any discount or membership benefits.

```csharp
int age = 20;
bool isStudent = true;
bool isVeteran = false;

// Check if any condition is true
bool eligibleForAnyBenefit = (age < 18) || (age >= 65) || isStudent || isVeteran;

Console.WriteLine($"Eligible for Any Benefit: {eligibleForAnyBenefit}"); // Output: True
```

### 2.3. Combining AND and OR Operators 🧮

By combining **AND** (`&&`) and **OR** (`||`) operators, you can create more complex Boolean expressions that reflect real-world logic more accurately.

#### Example: Complex Eligibility Check

Imagine you’re writing a program to check if someone is eligible for a special offer. To be eligible, the person must either be a member and a student, or a veteran.

```csharp
bool isMember = true;
bool isStudent = false;
bool isVeteran = true;

// Using AND and OR operators together
bool eligibleForSpecialOffer = (isMember && isStudent) || isVeteran;

Console.WriteLine($"Eligible for Special Offer: {eligibleForSpecialOffer}"); // Output: True
```

### 2.4. Using Parentheses for Clarity and Precedence 🎯

When combining AND and OR operators, it’s crucial to use **parentheses** to ensure that the expressions are evaluated in the correct order. Parentheses also make the code more readable by clearly indicating the intended grouping of conditions.

#### Example: Clarifying Complex Conditions

Let's extend the previous example to check if someone is eligible for a special offer based on more conditions:

1. The person must be a member and a student, or a veteran.
2. The person must also be over 18 years old.

Without parentheses, the Boolean expression might not work as intended due to operator precedence.

```csharp
bool isMember = true;
bool isStudent = false;
bool isVeteran = true;
int age = 20;

// Using parentheses for clarity and correct precedence
bool eligibleForSpecialOffer = ((isMember && isStudent) || isVeteran) && (age > 18);

Console.WriteLine($"Eligible for Special Offer: {eligibleForSpecialOffer}"); // Output: True
```

In this example, parentheses around `(isMember && isStudent) || isVeteran` ensure that this part of the expression is evaluated first, followed by the `age > 18` check.

### 2.5. Using NOT (`!`) for Negation 🚫

The **NOT** operator (`!`) negates a Boolean expression. It is used to reverse the logical state of its operand. If a condition is `true`, applying the NOT operator will make it `false`, and vice versa.

#### Example: Negating a Condition

Suppose you want to check if a person is *not* eligible for a discount:

```csharp
int age = 30;
bool hasMembershipCard = false;

// Checking if not eligible
bool notEligibleForDiscount = !(age >= 65) || !hasMembershipCard;

Console.WriteLine($"Not Eligible for Discount: {notEligibleForDiscount}"); // Output: True
```

#### Example: Combining NOT with Other Operators

The NOT operator can also be combined with AND and OR to create more nuanced expressions.

```csharp
bool isRaining = false;
bool hasUmbrella = true;

// Check if you can go outside
bool canGoOutside = !isRaining || hasUmbrella;

Console.WriteLine($"Can Go Outside: {canGoOutside}"); // Output: True
```

In this example, you can go outside if it’s not raining (`!isRaining`) or if you have an umbrella (`hasUmbrella`).

## 3. Practical Examples of Complex Boolean Expressions 🛠️

Let's explore some real-world scenarios where complex Boolean expressions are useful. These examples will help solidify your understanding of how to construct and use these expressions in practical applications.

### 3.1. Example: Access Control System 🔐

Imagine you are developing an access control system for a secure facility. Access is granted only if the person is an employee with a valid badge or a guest with a valid visitor pass and is accompanied by an employee.

#### Solution:

```csharp
bool isEmployee = true;
bool hasValidBadge = false;
bool isGuest = false;
bool hasVisitorPass = true;
bool accompaniedByEmployee = true;

// Complex condition to determine access
bool accessGranted = (isEmployee && 

### 3.1. Example: Access Control System (Continued) 🔐

In this example, we'll continue building the access control logic, ensuring that the conditions accurately reflect the requirements for granting access.

```csharp
bool isEmployee = true;
bool hasValidBadge = false;
bool isGuest = false;
bool hasVisitorPass = true;
bool accompaniedByEmployee = true;

// Complex condition to determine access
bool accessGranted = (isEmployee && hasValidBadge) || (isGuest && hasVisitorPass && accompaniedByEmployee);

Console.WriteLine($"Access Granted: {accessGranted}"); // Output: False
```

#### Explanation:

- **Employee Access**: `isEmployee && hasValidBadge` checks if the person is an employee and has a valid badge. Both conditions must be true to grant access to an employee.
- **Guest Access**: `(isGuest && hasVisitorPass && accompaniedByEmployee)` checks if the person is a guest, has a visitor pass, and is accompanied by an employee. All three conditions must be true to grant access to a guest.
- The entire expression uses the OR operator (`||`) to combine the two scenarios. Access is granted if either of the conditions is true.

### 3.2. Example: Online Shopping Cart Discounts 🛒

Let's consider an online shopping cart system where customers can get discounts based on different criteria:

1. **Loyalty Discount**: Applies if the customer is a member and the total purchase amount is over $100.
2. **Seasonal Discount**: Applies if there’s a seasonal sale, regardless of the customer’s membership status.
3. **Exclusive Offer**: Applies if the customer has an exclusive offer code.

#### Solution:

```csharp
bool isMember = true;
double totalPurchaseAmount = 150.0;
bool isSeasonalSale = false;
bool hasExclusiveOfferCode = true;

// Complex condition to determine discount eligibility
bool eligibleForDiscount = (isMember && totalPurchaseAmount > 100) || isSeasonalSale || hasExclusiveOfferCode;

Console.WriteLine($"Eligible for Discount: {eligibleForDiscount}"); // Output: True
```

#### Explanation:

- **Loyalty Discount**: `(isMember && totalPurchaseAmount > 100)` checks if the customer is a member and their purchase amount is over $100.
- **Seasonal Discount**: `isSeasonalSale` is a simple Boolean flag that indicates whether a seasonal sale is on.
- **Exclusive Offer**: `hasExclusiveOfferCode` checks if the customer has an exclusive offer code.
- The OR operator (`||`) combines these three conditions. If any of them are true, the customer is eligible for a discount.

### 3.3. Example: Loan Approval System 🏦

Imagine you are developing a loan approval system for a bank. The loan application is approved based on the following conditions:

1. **Credit Score**: The applicant must have a credit score of at least 700.
2. **Income Verification**: The applicant must provide income proof.
3. **Collateral Requirement**: If the credit score is below 700, collateral is required.

#### Solution:

```csharp
int creditScore = 680;
bool hasIncomeProof = true;
bool hasCollateral = true;

// Complex condition to determine loan approval
bool loanApproved = (creditScore >= 700 && hasIncomeProof) || (creditScore < 700 && hasIncomeProof && hasCollateral);

Console.WriteLine($"Loan Approved: {loanApproved}"); // Output: True
```

#### Explanation:

- **High Credit Score**: `(creditScore >= 700 && hasIncomeProof)` checks if the credit score is at least 700 and the applicant has provided income proof.
- **Low Credit Score**: `(creditScore < 700 && hasIncomeProof && hasCollateral)` checks if the credit score is below 700, the applicant has provided income proof, and the applicant has collateral.
- The OR operator (`||`) combines these two scenarios. The loan is approved if either of the conditions is met.

### 3.4. Example: Flight Booking System ✈️

Consider a flight booking system where different rules apply to customers:

1. **Priority Boarding**: Customers are eligible if they are in first class or have frequent flyer status.
2. **Check-In Baggage Fee Waiver**: Applies to customers in first class, with frequent flyer status, or who have purchased a premium ticket.

#### Solution:

```csharp
bool isFirstClass = false;
bool hasFrequentFlyerStatus = true;
bool hasPremiumTicket = true;

// Complex condition to determine priority boarding eligibility
bool priorityBoarding = isFirstClass || hasFrequentFlyerStatus;

// Complex condition to determine baggage fee waiver eligibility
bool baggageFeeWaiver = isFirstClass || hasFrequentFlyerStatus || hasPremiumTicket;

Console.WriteLine($"Priority Boarding: {priorityBoarding}");   // Output: True
Console.WriteLine($"Baggage Fee Waiver: {baggageFeeWaiver}"); // Output: True
```

#### Explanation:

- **Priority Boarding**: `isFirstClass || hasFrequentFlyerStatus` checks if the customer is in first class or has frequent flyer status. Either condition grants priority boarding.
- **Baggage Fee Waiver**: `isFirstClass || hasFrequentFlyerStatus || hasPremiumTicket` checks if the customer is in first class, has frequent flyer status, or has purchased a premium ticket. Any of these conditions waive the baggage fee.

## 4. Best Practices for Building Complex Boolean Expressions 🏆

Writing complex Boolean expressions can sometimes lead to code that is difficult to read and understand. Here are some best practices to help you write clear and maintainable code:

### 4.1. Use Descriptive Variable Names 📛

Use variable names that clearly describe the condition they represent. This makes your Boolean expressions easier to understand.

#### Example:

```csharp
bool isEmployee = true;
bool hasValidBadge = true;

// Good variable names make the code self-explanatory
bool accessGranted = isEmployee && hasValidBadge;
```

### 4.2. Use Parentheses for Clarity 🕶️

Even when not strictly necessary, using parentheses can help make the logic of your Boolean expressions clear. This is especially important when combining multiple operators.

#### Example:

```csharp
bool isMember = true;
double totalPurchaseAmount = 150.0;
bool isSeasonalSale = false;
bool hasExclusiveOfferCode = true;

// Parentheses clarify the intent of the expression
bool eligibleForDiscount = (isMember && totalPurchaseAmount > 100) || isSeasonalSale || hasExclusiveOfferCode;
```

### 4.3. Break Down Complex Expressions into Smaller Parts 🧩

If an expression becomes too complex, consider breaking it down into smaller, simpler expressions. This can make the code easier to understand and debug.

#### Example:

```csharp
bool isMember = true;
double totalPurchaseAmount = 150.0;
bool isSeasonalSale = false;
bool hasExclusiveOfferCode = true;

// Break down complex expressions into smaller parts
bool isLoyaltyEligible = isMember && totalPurchaseAmount > 100;
bool isAnyDiscountEligible = isLoyaltyEligible || isSeasonalSale || hasExclusiveOfferCode;

Console.WriteLine($"Eligible for Any Discount: {isAnyDiscountEligible}"); // Output: True
```

### 4.4. Avoid Negation When Possible 🚫

Negation (`!`) can make Boolean expressions harder to understand, especially when multiple conditions are involved. Try to phrase your conditions in positive terms whenever possible.

#### Example:

Instead of this:

```csharp
bool isNotAdult = age < 18;
bool isNotSenior = age < 65;

bool eligible = !isNotAdult && !isNotSenior; // Confusing
```

Do this:

```csharp
bool isAdult = age >= 18;
bool isSenior = age >= 65;

bool eligible = isAdult && !isSenior; // Clear
```

### 4.5. Test Your Expressions Thoroughly 🧪

Complex Boolean expressions can have many edge cases. Be sure to test your expressions with a variety of inputs to ensure they behave as expected.

#### Example:

```csharp
// Test cases for eligibility checks
int[] testAges = { 16, 18, 30, 65, 80 };
bool[] expectedEligibility = { false, true, true, true, false };

for (int i = 0; i < testAges.Length; i++)
{
    int age = testAges[i];
    bool isAdult = age >= 18;
    bool isSenior = age >= 65;

    bool eligible = isAdult && !isSenior;

    Console.WriteLine($"Age: {age}, Eligible: {eligible}, Expected: {expectedEligibility[i]}");
}
```

## 5. Conclusion 🎓

Building complex Boolean expressions is a fundamental skill in C# programming that allows you to implement sophisticated logic and make your applications dynamic and responsive. By mastering Boolean values, comparison operators, logical operators, and best practices, you can write clear, efficient, and maintainable code.

### Recap:

- **Boolean Expressions**: Logical statements that evaluate to `true` or `false`.

- **Logical Operators**: Combine Boolean expressions (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
- **Best Practices**: Use descriptive names, parentheses for clarity, break down complex expressions, avoid negation, and test thoroughly.

With these skills and tips, you’re well-equipped to handle any logic-based challenge in your C# programming journey. Keep practicing


# Chapter: Functions and Methods in C#

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on functions and methods in C#! 🎉 This chapter will cover everything you need to know about creating and using functions and methods in your C# programs. Understanding functions and methods is crucial because they allow you to write modular, reusable, and organized code. Let's dive deep into the world of functions and methods with practical, beginner-friendly examples. 🚀

---

## 1. Introduction to Functions and Methods in C#

In C#, **functions** and **methods** are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help you break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. While the terms "function" and "method" are often used interchangeably, in C#, they have subtle differences based on their context:

- **Function**: A general term for a block of code that performs a task and may return a value.
- **Method**: A function that is associated with an object or a class.

Let's explore the building blocks of functions and methods in C#.

### 1.1. Why Use Functions and Methods? 🤔

Functions and methods are essential for writing efficient and maintainable code. Here are some reasons why you should use them:

- **Reusability**: Write once, use multiple times! Functions allow you to reuse code without rewriting it.
- **Modularity**: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Readability**: Functions make your code easier to read and understand by providing meaningful names for specific tasks.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and fix bugs in your code since functions isolate functionality.

### 1.2. Anatomy of a Function/Method 🔬

A function or method in C# consists of several parts:

1. **Return Type**: The type of value the function returns. If no value is returned, use `void`.
2. **Function/Method Name**: A descriptive name that indicates what the function does.
3. **Parameters**: Input values that the function takes. Enclosed in parentheses `()`.
4. **Body**: The block of code that defines what the function does, enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

#### Example:

```csharp
// A simple method that adds two numbers
int Add(int a, int b)
{
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum;
}
```

In this example:
- **Return Type**: `int` - the function returns an integer.
- **Function Name**: `Add` - indicates that this function adds two numbers.
- **Parameters**: `int a` and `int b` - the numbers to be added.
- **Body**: The code inside `{}` that performs the addition.

## 2. Defining and Calling Functions 📝

Let’s start by learning how to define (create) and call (use) functions in C#. This section will cover basic function definitions, calling functions, and how to handle return values.

### 2.1. Defining a Simple Function ✍️

To define a function in C#, specify the return type, function name, parameters (if any), and the function body. 

#### Example: Defining a Function to Greet the User

```csharp
// Function to greet the user
void GreetUser()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, welcome to C# programming!");
}
```

This function, `GreetUser`, does not take any parameters and does not return a value (denoted by `void`). It simply prints a greeting message to the console.

### 2.2. Calling a Function 📞

Once a function is defined, you can call it from your `Main` method or any other function.

#### Example: Calling the GreetUser Function

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    GreetUser(); // Call the GreetUser function
}
```

Output:
```
Hello, welcome to C# programming!
```

### 2.3. Functions with Parameters 🎁

Functions can accept inputs called **parameters**. Parameters allow you to pass values to a function when you call it.

#### Example: Function with Parameters

```csharp
// Function to greet a user by name
void GreetUserByName(string name)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}! Welcome to C# programming!");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    GreetUserByName("Alice"); // Call the function with "Alice" as an argument
}
```

Output:
```
Hello, Alice! Welcome to C# programming!
```

In this example, `GreetUserByName` takes one parameter `name` of type `string`. When the function is called with `"Alice"` as an argument, it prints a personalized greeting.

### 2.4. Functions with Return Values 🔄

Functions can return a value to the caller. To return a value, use the `return` keyword followed by the value to return.

#### Example: Function with Return Value

```csharp
// Function to add two numbers and return the result
int Add(int a, int b)
{
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum; // Return the result
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int result = Add(5, 7); // Call the function and store the result
    Console.WriteLine($"The sum is: {result}");
}
```

Output:
```
The sum is: 12
```

In this example, `Add` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, adds them, and returns the result. The returned value is stored in the variable `result` in the `Main` method.

## 3. Method Overloading 🔄

**Method overloading** allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Overloading methods can make your code more flexible and easier to read by providing multiple ways to perform similar operations.

### 3.1. Basic Method Overloading 📚

To overload a method, define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (different number of parameters, different types of parameters, or both).

#### Example: Overloading the `Add` Method

```csharp
// Overloaded method to add two integers
int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

// Overloaded method to add three integers
int Add(int a, int b, int c)
{
    return a + b + c;
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int result1 = Add(5, 7);    // Calls the first Add method
    int result2 = Add(5, 7, 3); // Calls the second Add method

    Console.WriteLine($"The sum of two numbers is: {result1}");
    Console.WriteLine($"The sum of three numbers is: {result2}");
}
```

Output:
```
The sum of two numbers is: 12
The sum of three numbers is: 15
```

In this example, the `Add` method is overloaded with two versions: one that adds two integers and another that adds three integers.

### 3.2. Practical Example: Calculating Area with Overloading 🏠

Let's create overloaded methods to calculate the area of different shapes using the same method name, `CalculateArea`.

```csharp
// Method to calculate area of a rectangle
double CalculateArea(double length, double width)
{
    return length * width;
}

// Method to calculate area of a circle
double CalculateArea(double radius)
{
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    double rectangleArea = CalculateArea(5.0, 3.0); // Calls the rectangle area method
    double circleArea = CalculateArea(4.0);         // Calls the circle area method

    Console.WriteLine($"The area of the rectangle is: {rectangleArea}");
    Console.WriteLine($"The area of the circle is: {circleArea}");
}
```

Output:
```
The area of the rectangle is: 15
The area of the circle is: 50.26548245743669
```

### 3.3. Best Practices for Method Overloading 🛠️

When using method overloading, keep the following best practices in mind:

- **Consistency**: Ensure that overloaded methods perform similar operations. Different behaviors under the same method name can confuse users.
- **Clarity**: Use meaningful parameter names and types to make it clear what each overloaded method does.
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Overloading methods with parameters that could lead to ambiguous calls should be avoided.

## 4. Passing Parameters: By Value vs. By Reference 🔄

Understanding how parameters are passed to functions is crucial for writing effective C# code. In C#, parameters can be passed **by value** or **by reference**.

### 4.1. Passing Parameters by Value 📦

When you pass a parameter **by value**, a copy of the value is passed to the function. Modifying the parameter inside the function does not affect the original value.

#### Example: Passing by Value

```csharp
void Increment(int number)
{
    number++;
    Console.WriteLine($"Inside Increment method: {number}");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int myNumber = 5;
    Increment(myNumber);
    Console.WriteLine($"After calling Increment method: {myNumber}");
}
```

Output:
```
Inside Increment method: 6
After calling Increment method: 5
```

In this example, `Increment` receives a copy of `myNumber`. Modifying `number` inside the function does not change the original `myNumber`.

### 4.2. Passing Parameters by Reference 🔄

When you pass a parameter **by reference**, the function receives a reference to the original variable
, allowing it to modify the original variable's value directly. In C#, you can pass parameters by reference using the `ref` or `out` keywords.

#### Example: Passing by Reference with `ref`

The `ref` keyword allows you to pass a variable by reference to a method, meaning any changes made to the parameter will directly affect the original variable.

```csharp
void Increment(ref int number)
{
    number++;
    Console.WriteLine($"Inside Increment method: {number}");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int myNumber = 5;
    Increment(ref myNumber);
    Console.WriteLine($"After calling Increment method: {myNumber}");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Inside Increment method: 6
After calling Increment method: 6
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Increment` method receives a reference to `myNumber` due to the `ref` keyword. 
- Changes made to `number` inside `Increment` affect `myNumber` directly, so `myNumber` is incremented by 1.

#### Example: Passing by Reference with `out`

The `out` keyword is similar to `ref`, but it is used when the method is expected to initialize the parameter. Parameters passed with `out` do not need to be initialized before being passed to the method, but they must be initialized inside the method.

```csharp
void Initialize(out int number)
{
    number = 42;
    Console.WriteLine($"Inside Initialize method: {number}");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int myNumber; // Note: No initial value
    Initialize(out myNumber);
    Console.WriteLine($"After calling Initialize method: {myNumber}");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Inside Initialize method: 42
After calling Initialize method: 42
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Initialize` method sets the `number` parameter to `42`. Since it’s passed using `out`, `myNumber` must be assigned a value inside the method.
- The method modifies `myNumber` directly, setting it to `42`.

### 4.3. Choosing Between `ref` and `out` 🧐

- **Use `ref`** when you need to modify an existing variable and the variable has already been initialized before it is passed to the method.
- **Use `out`** when the method is responsible for initializing the variable. This is useful for methods that need to return multiple values or when you need to initialize variables within the method.

### 4.4. Practical Example: Swapping Two Variables 🔄

Let's use `ref` to create a method that swaps the values of two variables.

```csharp
void Swap(ref int x, ref int y)
{
    int temp = x;
    x = y;
    y = temp;
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;

    Console.WriteLine($"Before Swap: a = {a}, b = {b}");
    Swap(ref a, ref b);
    Console.WriteLine($"After Swap: a = {a}, b = {b}");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Before Swap: a = 5, b = 10
After Swap: a = 10, b = 5
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Swap` method takes two parameters by reference using `ref`.
- It swaps the values of `a` and `b` by manipulating the references directly.

## 5. Optional Parameters and Named Arguments 📝

C# provides features like **optional parameters** and **named arguments** that enhance the flexibility and readability of your methods.

### 5.1. Optional Parameters 🕹️

Optional parameters allow you to define parameters that have default values. These parameters are optional when calling the method; if you omit them, the default values are used.

#### Example: Method with Optional Parameters

```csharp
void PrintMessage(string message, int repeatCount = 1)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < repeatCount; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    PrintMessage("Hello, World!");         // Uses default repeatCount of 1
    PrintMessage("Hello, again!", 3);      // Overrides repeatCount with 3
}
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
Hello, again!
Hello, again!
Hello, again!
```

**Explanation:**

- The `PrintMessage` method has an optional parameter `repeatCount` with a default value of `1`.
- When called without specifying `repeatCount`, the default value is used.
- When called with a specific `repeatCount`, it overrides the default value.

### 5.2. Named Arguments 📛

Named arguments allow you to specify the values of parameters by their names, rather than by their positions. This improves code readability and reduces errors, especially when a method has multiple parameters.

#### Example: Method with Named Arguments

```csharp
void PrintDetails(string name, int age, string city)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, City: {city}");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Using named arguments for clarity
    PrintDetails(age: 25, name: "Alice", city: "New York");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Name: Alice, Age: 25, City: New York
```

**Explanation:**

- Named arguments allow you to specify parameters in any order, making the call to `PrintDetails` clearer and reducing the chance of errors.

### 5.3. Combining Optional Parameters and Named Arguments 🎯

You can combine optional parameters and named arguments to write flexible and readable code.

#### Example: Using Both Features

```csharp
void DisplayInfo(string name, string profession = "Unknown", int age = 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Profession: {profession}, Age: {age}");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Omitting optional parameters
    DisplayInfo("Bob");

    // Specifying optional parameters using named arguments
    DisplayInfo("Alice", age: 30);

    // Using all parameters
    DisplayInfo("John", "Developer", 35);
}
```

**Output:**
```
Name: Bob, Profession: Unknown, Age: 0
Name: Alice, Profession: Unknown, Age: 30
Name: John, Profession: Developer, Age: 35
```

**Explanation:**

- The `DisplayInfo` method demonstrates both optional parameters and named arguments.
- Different combinations of arguments showcase the flexibility of these features.

## 6. Recursive Methods 🔄

A **recursive method** is a method that calls itself. Recursion can simplify code for problems that have repetitive or nested sub-problems, such as calculating factorials or traversing directories.

### 6.1. Understanding Recursion 🌀

Recursion requires a **base case** to prevent infinite loops. The base case is the condition under which the recursive method stops calling itself.

#### Example: Calculating Factorial Using Recursion

```csharp
int Factorial(int n)
{
    // Base case: If n is 0, return 1
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;

    // Recursive case: n * factorial of (n - 1)
    return n * Factorial(n - 1);
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int number = 5;
    int result = Factorial(number);
    Console.WriteLine($"Factorial of {number} is {result}");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Factorial` method is recursive because it calls itself.
- The base case is `if (n == 0) return 1;` to prevent infinite recursion.
- For other cases, `n * Factorial(n - 1)` calculates the factorial recursively.

### 6.2. Practical Example: Calculating Fibonacci Numbers 🐇

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example for practicing recursion. Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones.

#### Example: Recursive Fibonacci Calculation

```csharp
int Fibonacci(int n)
{
    // Base cases
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;

    // Recursive case
    return Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2);
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int n = 6;
    int fibonacci = Fibonacci(n);
    Console.WriteLine($"Fibonacci of {n} is {fibonacci}");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Fibonacci of 6 is 8
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Fibonacci` method calculates the nth Fibonacci number recursively.
- Base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1` prevent infinite recursion.
- The method calls itself twice for each Fibonacci calculation, reflecting the sequence's definition.

### 6.3. Recursion Best Practices and Pitfalls ⚠️

**Best Practices:**

- **Always have a base case** to avoid infinite recursion.
- **Be cautious of stack overflow**: Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the method calls itself too many times.
- **Consider iterative solutions**: Sometimes, iterative solutions are more efficient and easier to understand than recursive ones.

**Pitfalls:**

- **Performance**: Recursive methods can be less efficient than their iterative counterparts due to the overhead of multiple method calls.
- **Readability**: While recursion can simplify code, overly complex recursive logic can be hard to follow.

## 7. Lambda Expressions

## 7. Lambda Expressions 🏹

Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent anonymous methods using a syntax that is shorter and more readable. They are particularly useful when working with collections, delegates, and LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) in C#. Lambda expressions allow you to write inline functions, making your code more expressive and functional.

### 7.1. Understanding Lambda Expressions 📜

A lambda expression is an anonymous function that you can use to create delegates or expression tree types. It uses the lambda operator `=>`, which is read as "goes to".

#### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a lambda expression is:

```csharp
(parameters) => expression
```

- **Parameters**: The input parameters for the lambda expression. These can be omitted if the lambda expression does not require any parameters.
- **Expression**: The body of the lambda expression. This can be a single expression or a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

### 7.2. Simple Lambda Expressions 📝

Let's start with some simple examples to illustrate how lambda expressions work.

#### Example: Lambda Expression with No Parameters

```csharp
// Lambda expression with no parameters
Action greet = () => Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    greet();  // Output: Hello, World!
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The lambda expression `() => Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!")` represents an anonymous function with no parameters that writes a message to the console.
- The `Action` delegate represents a method that does not return a value and takes no parameters.

#### Example: Lambda Expression with One Parameter

```csharp
// Lambda expression with one parameter
Func<int, int> square = x => x * x;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int result = square(5);  // Output: 25
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The lambda expression `x => x * x` represents an anonymous function that takes one parameter `x` and returns `x` squared.
- The `Func<int, int>` delegate represents a method that takes one integer parameter and returns an integer.

#### Example: Lambda Expression with Multiple Parameters

```csharp
// Lambda expression with multiple parameters
Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int result = add(3, 4);  // Output: 7
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The lambda expression `(x, y) => x + y` represents an anonymous function that takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum.
- The `Func<int, int, int>` delegate represents a method that takes two integer parameters and returns an integer.

### 7.3. Lambda Expressions with Statements 🧩

Lambda expressions can also contain multiple statements, similar to methods. In such cases, you need to use curly braces `{}` to define the body of the lambda expression.

#### Example: Lambda Expression with Multiple Statements

```csharp
// Lambda expression with multiple statements
Func<int, int, int> addAndSquare = (x, y) =>
{
    int sum = x + y;
    return sum * sum;
};

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int result = addAndSquare(3, 4);  // Output: 49
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The lambda expression `(x, y) => { int sum = x + y; return sum * sum; }` contains multiple statements inside curly braces.
- The `addAndSquare` lambda first adds `x` and `y`, then squares the sum.

### 7.4. Practical Example: Using Lambda Expressions with Collections 📚

Lambda expressions are often used with collections to perform operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.

#### Example: Filtering a List Using Lambda Expressions

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

    // Use lambda expression to filter even numbers
    List<int> evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0).ToList();

    Console.WriteLine("Even numbers:");
    foreach (int num in evenNumbers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(num);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Even numbers:
2
4
6
8
10
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Where` method filters elements in a collection based on a condition. The lambda expression `n => n % 2 == 0` checks if a number is even.
- The `ToList` method converts the result back to a list.

#### Example: Transforming a List Using Lambda Expressions

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

    // Use lambda expression to square each number
    List

each number in the list using the `Select` method:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

    // Use lambda expression to square each number
    List<int> squaredNumbers = numbers.Select(n => n * n).ToList();

    Console.WriteLine("Squared numbers:");
    foreach (int num in squaredNumbers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(num);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Squared numbers:
1
4
9
16
25
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Select` method projects each element of a sequence into a new form. In this example, the lambda expression `n => n * n` squares each number in the list.
- The `ToList` method converts the result into a list.

### 7.5. Using Lambda Expressions with LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) 🔍

Lambda expressions are a key feature when working with LINQ in C#. They allow you to create concise and readable queries for collections and databases.

#### Example: LINQ Query Using Lambda Expressions

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    List<string> fruits = new List<string> { "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig", "grape" };

    // Use lambda expression with LINQ to find fruits with more than 5 letters
    var longFruits = fruits.Where(f => f.Length > 5).ToList();

    Console.WriteLine("Fruits with more than 5 letters:");
    foreach (string fruit in longFruits)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(fruit);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Fruits with more than 5 letters:
banana
cherry
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Where` method is used with a lambda expression to filter elements based on a condition. In this case, `f => f.Length > 5` checks if the fruit name has more than 5 letters.
- The `ToList` method converts the filtered results into a list.

### 7.6. Practical Example: Using Lambda Expressions for Sorting 🗂️

Lambda expressions can also be used to specify sorting logic for collections.

#### Example: Sorting a List of Objects Using Lambda Expressions

```csharp
class Product
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    List<Product> products = new List<Product>
    {
        new Product { Name = "Laptop", Price = 999.99m },
        new Product { Name = "Smartphone", Price = 499.99m },
        new Product { Name = "Tablet", Price = 299.99m }
    };

    // Use lambda expression to sort products by price
    var sortedProducts = products.OrderBy(p => p.Price).ToList();

    Console.WriteLine("Products sorted by price:");
    foreach (Product product in sortedProducts)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{product.Name}: ${product.Price}");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Products sorted by price:
Tablet: $299.99
Smartphone: $499.99
Laptop: $999.99
```

**Explanation:**

- The `OrderBy` method sorts the elements of a sequence in ascending order according to a key. The lambda expression `p => p.Price` specifies that products should be sorted by their price.
- The `ToList` method converts the sorted sequence back into a list.

### 7.7. Limitations and Considerations of Lambda Expressions ⚠️

**While lambda expressions provide a powerful tool for concise and expressive code, they do have some limitations and considerations:**

1. **Readability**: Overusing lambda expressions, especially complex ones, can make the code harder to read and understand. It's essential to balance conciseness with clarity.
2. **Debugging**: Debugging lambda expressions can be challenging because they are anonymous methods without a name or separate method body.
3. **Performance**: Lambda expressions can sometimes introduce performance overhead, especially when used excessively in performance-critical code. It's important to profile and test code to ensure that lambda expressions do not negatively impact performance.

## 8. Methods as First-Class Citizens and Delegates 🏛️

In C#, methods are first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other methods. This concept is closely related to **delegates**—types that represent references to methods with a specific signature.

### 8.1. Understanding Delegates 📜

A **delegate** is a type-safe pointer to a method. Delegates are used to pass methods as arguments to other methods, define callback methods, and implement event handling. A delegate declaration specifies the method signature that it can reference.

#### Basic Delegate Declaration

```csharp
// Delegate declaration
public delegate int MathOperation(int a, int b);
```

- **`MathOperation`**: The delegate name.
- **`int a, int b`**: The parameters and their types for methods referenced by this delegate.
- **`int`**: The return type for methods referenced by this delegate.

### 8.2. Creating and Using Delegates 🛠️

Let's see how to create and use delegates with some practical examples.

#### Example: Basic Delegate Usage

```csharp
public delegate int MathOperation(int a, int b);

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Assign a method to a delegate
    MathOperation add = (x, y) => x + y;
    MathOperation multiply = (x, y) => x * y;

    // Use the delegate to call the methods
    Console.WriteLine($"Addition: {add(3, 4)}");    // Output: 7
    Console.WriteLine($"Multiplication: {multiply(3, 4)}"); // Output: 12
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`MathOperation`** delegate represents methods that take two integers as parameters and return an integer.
- **Lambda expressions** are used to define `add` and `multiply` methods that can be assigned to the delegate.

#### Example: Passing Delegates as Method Parameters

Delegates can be passed as parameters to methods, allowing methods to be more flexible and reusable.

```csharp
public delegate int MathOperation(int a, int b);

static int PerformOperation(int a, int b, MathOperation operation)
{
    return operation(a, b);
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    MathOperation add = (x, y) => x + y;
    MathOperation multiply = (x, y) => x * y;

    int sum = PerformOperation(3, 4, add);    // Output: 7
    int product = PerformOperation(3, 4, multiply);  // Output: 12

    Console.WriteLine($"Sum: {sum}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Product: {product}");
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `PerformOperation` method takes two integers and a `MathOperation` delegate as parameters.
- The delegate is used to perform an operation on the integers, making the method flexible for different mathematical operations.

### 8.3. Built-in Delegates: `Action` and `Func` 🛠️

C# provides built-in delegates for common use cases:

- **`Action`**: Represents a method that does not return a value.
- **`Func`**: Represents a method that returns a value.

#### Example: Using `Action` and `Func` Delegates

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Action delegate with no parameters
    Action greet = () => Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    greet();  // Output: Hello, World!

    // Func delegate with parameters and a return value
    Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;
    int result = add(3, 4);  // Output: 7
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`Action` delegate**: Represents a method that takes no parameters and does not return a value.
- **`Func` delegate**: Represents a method that takes two integer parameters and returns an integer.

### 8.4. Practical Example: Event Handling with Delegates 🛎️

Delegates are fundamental for implementing event handling in C#. An **event** is a message sent by an object to signal the occurrence of an action. A **subscriber** can then respond to that action.

#### Example: Creating and Handling Events

```csharp
// Define a delegate for the event
public delegate void NotificationEventHandler(string message);

class Notifier
{
    // Declare the event using the delegate
    public event NotificationEventHandler NotificationEvent;

    public void Notify(string message)
    {
        // Invoke the event, notifying all subscribers
        NotificationEvent?.Invoke(message);
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Notifier notifier = new Notifier();

    // Subscribe to the event using a lambda expression
    notifier.NotificationEvent += message => Console.WriteLine($"Received notification: {message}");

    // Trigger the event
    notifier.Notify("This is a test notification.");
}
```

**Output:**
```
Received notification: This is a test notification.
```

**Explanation:**

- **`NotificationEventHandler` delegate**: Defines the signature for methods that handle notifications.
- **`NotificationEvent` event**: Uses the delegate to define an event that can be subscribed to.
- **Lambda expression**: Subscribes to the event and specifies what should happen when the event is triggered



#### Example: Creating and Handling Events (continued)

```csharp
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Notifier notifier = new Notifier();

        // Subscribe to the event using a method
        notifier.NotificationEvent += OnNotificationReceived;

        // Trigger the event
        notifier.Notify("This is another test notification.");
    }

    // Event handler method
    static void OnNotificationReceived(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Received notification: {message}");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Received notification: This is another test notification.
```

**Explanation:**

- The `OnNotificationReceived` method handles the `NotificationEvent`, demonstrating how events can be managed with standard method subscriptions.

## 9. Method Overloading and Overriding 🔄

### 9.1. Method Overloading 🚀

**Method overloading** allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. It is useful for performing similar operations with different types or numbers of parameters.

#### Example: Method Overloading

```csharp
class MathOperations
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double Add(double a, double b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int Add(int a, int b, int c)
    {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    MathOperations math = new MathOperations();
    
    Console.WriteLine($"Add(2, 3): {math.Add(2, 3)}");              // Output: 5
    Console.WriteLine($"Add(2.5, 3.5): {math.Add(2.5, 3.5)}");      // Output: 6.0
    Console.WriteLine($"Add(1, 2, 3): {math.Add(1, 2, 3)}");        // Output: 6
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Add` method is overloaded with different parameter lists: two integers, two doubles, and three integers.
- This allows `Add` to handle various types of inputs appropriately.

### 9.2. Method Overriding 🔄

**Method overriding** allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. To override a method, use the `virtual` keyword in the base class and the `override` keyword in the derived class.

#### Example: Method Overriding

```csharp
class Animal
{
    public virtual void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void MakeSound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bark");
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Animal myAnimal = new Dog();
    myAnimal.MakeSound();  // Output: Bark
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `MakeSound` method is marked as `virtual` in the `Animal` class, allowing it to be overridden.
- The `Dog` class overrides `MakeSound` with its own implementation.
- When `myAnimal` calls `MakeSound`, it uses the `Dog` class's implementation, demonstrating polymorphism.

### 9.3. Using `new` Keyword for Hiding Methods 🔍

You can use the `new` keyword to hide a method in a derived class. This is different from overriding, as it does not provide polymorphic behavior.

#### Example: Method Hiding

```csharp
class BaseClass
{
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("BaseClass Display");
    }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public new void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("DerivedClass Display");
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    BaseClass baseObj = new BaseClass();
    BaseClass derivedAsBase = new DerivedClass();
    DerivedClass derivedObj = new DerivedClass();

    baseObj.Display();          // Output: BaseClass Display
    derivedAsBase.Display();   // Output: BaseClass Display (base method is called)
    derivedObj.Display();      // Output: DerivedClass Display
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Display` method in `DerivedClass` uses the `new` keyword to hide the `Display` method in `BaseClass`.
- When calling `Display` on a `DerivedClass` object, the hidden method is invoked. However, if called through a base class reference, the base class method is used.

## 10. Method Attributes and Annotations 📜

Attributes in C# provide a way to add metadata to your methods. This metadata can be used for various purposes, such as code documentation, runtime behavior, or controlling code generation.

### 10.1. Common Method Attributes 📚

#### Example: Using `Obsolete` Attribute

The `Obsolete` attribute marks methods that are no longer recommended for use.

```csharp
class Program
{
    [Obsolete("This method is deprecated. Use NewMethod instead.")]
    public static void OldMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Old method");
    }

    public static void NewMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("New method");
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        OldMethod();  // Generates a compiler warning
        NewMethod();  // Recommended method
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Obsolete` attribute generates a compiler warning when `OldMethod` is called, informing developers to use `NewMethod` instead.

#### Example: Using `DebuggerStepThrough` Attribute

The `DebuggerStepThrough` attribute instructs the debugger to step through the code without breaking into it.

```csharp
class Program
{
    [DebuggerStepThrough]
    public static void FastMethod()
    {
        // This method will be skipped during debugging
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        FastMethod();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `DebuggerStepThrough` attribute tells the debugger to skip stepping into the `FastMethod`, making debugging more efficient.

## 11. Advanced Method Concepts 🌟

### 11.1. Anonymous Methods

Anonymous methods are inline methods defined using the `delegate` keyword, which can be useful when you need a quick method without defining a separate named method.

#### Example: Using Anonymous Methods

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Define an anonymous method
    Action<string> greet = delegate (string name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Hello, {name}!");
    };

    greet("Alice");  // Output: Hello, Alice!
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Action<string>` delegate is assigned an anonymous method that takes a string parameter and prints a greeting.

### 11.2. Expression Trees

Expression trees represent code in a tree-like data structure, where each node is an expression. They are particularly useful for building dynamic queries and for code analysis.

#### Example: Creating Expression Trees

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq.Expressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Define an expression tree
        Expression<Func<int, int, int>> addExpression = (x, y) => x + y;

        // Compile the expression tree to a delegate
        Func<int, int, int> add = addExpression.Compile();

        int result = add(5, 3);  // Output: 8
        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Expression<Func<int, int, int>>` defines an expression tree for an addition operation.
- The `Compile` method converts the expression tree into a delegate that can be invoked.
